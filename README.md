- **Python**: Used for backend logic and data processing.
- **SQLite**: For storing channel and video data.
- **Google API**: Fetches YouTube channel data.
- **CSV**: Exports the collected data to CSV files.

Planning to add automation features in the future in regards to PowerBI, currently it is a manual upload from the csv files. Furthermore, the current code does not contain detailed documentation.
